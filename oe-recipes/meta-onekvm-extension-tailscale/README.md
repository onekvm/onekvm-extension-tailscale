# OpenEmbedded layer

This layer packages the Tailscale extension for OneKVM. It supports the
`wrynose` release and depends on OE-Core, `meta-networking`, and the
distro-owned `onekvm` layer, which provides `onekvm-extension.bbclass`.

The extension package directly depends on the `tailscale` package provided by
`meta-networking`. The integrating distro must set `ONEKVM_COMPONENT_SRCREV`
to the same fixed component commit that supplies this layer. OneKVM release
builds derive that value from the distro component lock instead of storing a
self-referential commit in this recipe.
